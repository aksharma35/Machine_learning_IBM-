unsupervised learning
_____________________

CLassification algorithm-------Classification algorithms predict categorical classed labels. 
This means assigning instances to predefined classes such as defaulted or not defaulted.

 classification is a supervised learning where each training data instance belongs to a particular class.

Clustering Algorithm
======
In clustering however, the data is unlabeled and the process is unsupervised. 
For example, we can use a clustering algorithm such as k-means to group similar customers as mentioned, and assign them to a cluster,
based on whether they share similar attributes, such as; age, education, and so on.


+++++++++++++++++
clustering is used for fraud detection in claims analysis, 
or to evaluate the insurance risk of certain customers based on their segments.
In medicine, it can be used to characterize patient behavior, based on their similar characteristics. 
So as to identify successful medical therapies for different illnesses or in biology, 
clustering is used to group genes with similar expression patterns or to cluster genetic markers to identify family ties.


1.Partition-based clustering ------------K-Means, K-Medians or Fuzzy c
2.Hierarchical clustering algorithms----This group of algorithms are very intuitive and are generally good for use with small size datasets.
3.Density-based clustering algorithms----They are especially good when dealing with spatial clusters or when there is noise in your data set. For example, the DB scan algorithm.
